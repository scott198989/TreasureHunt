## Introduction

Welcome to TreasureHunt! This is a reworked version of a game from Jump Start at LEARN Academy. It's still a work in progress, but I decided to rebuild it using React.js to utilize state management more effectively.

## Technologies

- React.js
- Yarn

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to have Yarn installed. Once you have that, clone the repo and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## How to Play
